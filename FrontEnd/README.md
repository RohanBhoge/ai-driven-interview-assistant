# AI-Driven Interview Assistance.

AI-Driven Interview Assistance is an innovative platform designed to simulate real-time interview experiences. The system uses MERN Stack technology to build a full-stack application that integrates an AI assistant for dynamic question generation and analysis. By uploading a resume, the AI asks skill-specific questions, evaluates responses, and adjusts the difficulty based on user performance. The interview session is recorded in video format for self-assessment or peer review. This project also incorporates OpenAIâ€™s API for advanced language processing to create a personalized and interactive interview environment.
